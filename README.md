# Game Animation Sample with Overlay Layering | Unreal Engine 5

## Introduction

This project integrates the ALS Overlay Layering System into the new Unreal Engine Motion Matching Game Animation Sample.
Advanced Locomotion System (ALS) provides a nice Overlay System that allows us to alter the entire locomotion animation just by applying simple overlay poses. 

## Features

- Game Animation Sample
- Overlay layering system built with separate Anim Graphs and Linked Layers
- All overlays from ALS
- Basic weapon attach system from ALS
- Basic overlay switcher widget from ALS
- Removed Echo and Twinblast characters and Manny/Quinn 4k textures to lower project size

## Overview

An overview of the system is available on my YouTube channel [Polygon Hive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDWNfIqvWBk&list=PLs9e0eJQMI2aaulgKJzC8feN1UEwDkEnq)

## Migrating Plugin

To migrate the GASPALS plugin to your own Unreal Engine project, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the `Plugins/GASPALS` folder to your project's `Plugins` folder.
2. Merge the `Plugins/GASPALS/Config` files with your project's `Config` files.
3. Copy `DefaultEngine.ini` content at the end of your project's `DefaultEngine.ini`.
4. Copy `Tags/GameplayTags_GASPALS.ini` to your project's `Config/Tags` folder.
5. Launch the project, an error message will prompt you to add collision settings, click add at the end of the message.
6. Enjoy :)
